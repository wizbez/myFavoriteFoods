                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are two fourteen year olds living in Vail, Colorado; one of us is a freshmen in highschool and the other is in 8th grade. We are very passionate about skiing. We both want to raise awareness about avalanches because one of our friends died in one about a year ago.  We both go to the Vail Mountain School, and we were able to make this through the Youth Lead the Change program.</p>

                    <p>I love sports, and music.  I nordic ski, I alpine ski, also I play baseball, football, and I love to swim and run.  In school, I work very hard and do many extracurriculars.  For example, I am in a jazz band called “Coffee House Combo” who played at the TEDX Vail.  I have done many things in my life, I love to have fun, and do a good job at whatever I do.</p>

                    <p>Music, athletics, and academics are the three things that make up who I am. I am an extremely musical person. I play three instruments, the piano, guitar, and saxophone. In addition to playing piano I also teach piano to kids from second to eighth grade, and I use my musical talents to also compose music. I do this through a program called Very Young Composers, which I have been doing for five years. In athletics, I am a basketball and tennis player. I backcountry ski and am a veteran of alpine skiing. Skiing in the backcountry is my main reason for making this organization because a couple of my friends died of avalanches and if they knew more about avalanches some of them might have survived. Furthermore, I have earned my black belt in taekwondo and I am a track sprinter. Lastly, I am a dedicated swimmer for the Vail Hurricanes. In my academics area, I am a straight A student; In school I also play saxophone for the school band in which I have performed for the whole school multiple times.</p>
